# Smart Stocktake Application

A full-stack warehouse stocktake application with camera input, AI-powered product data extraction, offline capability, and role-based access control.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Camera Integration**: Take photos of products directly from mobile devices or upload existing images
- **AI Product Extraction**: Uses Google Cloud Vision API to extract:
  - Product name
  - Barcode/SKU
  - Lot number
  - Pack size
- **Manual Data Entry**: Stocktakers can enter:
  - Actual quantity and unit type (pallet, case, layer)
  - Branch/warehouse location
  - Specific location code (e.g., A-01, B-12)
  - Expiry date for FEFO tracking
- **Bulk Upload**: CSV import for mass product data updates (Manager/Admin only)
  - Product number, description, lot, expiry date
  - Branch, location, stock levels
  - Stock on hand, allocated, and available quantities
- **Offline Support**: Queue entries locally when offline, sync when connection restored
- **Variance Reporting**: Automatic calculation of differences between expected and actual stock
- **Role-Based Access**: Three distinct user roles with appropriate permissions

### User Roles

#### Stocktaker (Default)
- Take product photos and create stocktake entries
- View their own entries
- Access sync queue to upload pending entries
- Cannot access reports or user management

#### Manager
- All stocktaker permissions
- View all stocktake entries from all users
- Access variance reports
- Review and mark variances as reviewed/resolved
- Bulk upload products via CSV
- Cannot manage users

#### Admin
- All manager permissions
- Full user management capabilities
- Edit user roles
- Delete users
- View all system data
- Access the Administrator Control Panel for operational oversight
- Create stocktake events and register warehouses directly in-app

### Administrator Control Panel

The admin dashboard gives programme leads a live cockpit to govern every aspect of the deployment:

- **Operational Snapshot** – At-a-glance metrics covering user population, warehouse coverage, active stocktake events, and the volume of unresolved variances.
- **Variance Watchlist** – Highlights up to five outstanding variances that still need action so reconciliation efforts stay on track.
- **Recent Activity Feed** – Streams the latest stocktake entries with user, quantity, and location context for quick auditing.
- **Role Distribution Analytics** – Summarises how many stocktakers, managers, and admins exist to ensure proper coverage.
- **Focus Controls** – Switch the globally selected event and warehouse to drive exports, reporting, and downstream experiences.
- **Event Lifecycle Management** – Create new stocktake events, update their status (draft, active, paused, completed, archived), and mark the event currently in focus.
- **Warehouse Registry** – Register additional sites without leaving the dashboard to keep assignment options current.

Use the refresh action in the panel header to reload metrics, events, and warehouse lists after making changes.

## API Integration

### Google Cloud Vision API

To enable real AI extraction (currently using mock data):

1. Get a Google Cloud Vision API key from Google Cloud Console
2. The API key is automatically configured as a secret in Supabase Edge Functions
3. No manual configuration needed - the system handles it automatically

The Edge Function endpoint:
```
POST /functions/v1/extract-product-info
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <anon-key>
Body: { "image_base64": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..." }
```

### Supabase Storage

Images are stored in the `stocktake-images` bucket with:
- Public read access for viewing
- Authenticated write access for uploads
- Automatic URL generation for database storage

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have comprehensive RLS policies:
- Users can only view their own data by default
- Managers can view all operational data
- Admins have full access
- All policies require authentication

### Data Validation
- Input validation on forms
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Database constraints and foreign keys
- Secure file upload handling

### Authentication
- Email/password authentication via Supabase
- Secure session management
- Automatic token refresh
- Protected routes based on role

## Offline Capability

The sync queue system provides offline support:
- Entries saved to localStorage when created
- Automatically queued if offline
- Manual or automatic sync when online
- Progress tracking during sync
- Error handling with retry capability

### Running Tests
```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Uploading
- Check storage bucket permissions
- Verify authentication token is valid
- Check browser console for errors

### AI Extraction Not Working
- Verify Google Cloud Vision API key is configured
- Check Edge Function logs in Supabase dashboard
- Falls back to mock data if API key not configured

### Variance Reports Not Generating
- Ensure product exists with matching barcode
- Check stocktake entry has synced = true
- Verify trigger function is enabled

### Permission Denied Errors
- Check user role in user_profiles table
- Verify RLS policies are enabled
- Ensure user is authenticated
